(1) **Environments and frames:**
1. The parent of a frame is the parent of the function called

2. When a function needs an argument but can't find it in its current frame, it will search for it in parent frames and use the first value it finds 
```python
def make_adder(n):
    """
    >>> adder_three = make_adder(3)
    >>> adder_three(5)
    8
    """
    def adder(x):
        return x + n
    return adder
# The parent of function adder and its frame is make_adder
```

3. **Intrinsic name**(the name bound to a value when it was created) **never changes**. The functions returned by lambda expressions have no meaningful intrinsic names(which is `<lambda>`)

(2) **Self-referrence:**
A function can return itself of its parent function as return value
```python
def print_and_return(x):
    print(x)
    return print_and_return
print_and_return(1)(3)(5)

def print_and_sum(x):
    print(x)
    def next_sum(y):
        return print_and_sum(x + y)
    return next_sum
print_and_sum(1)(3)(5)
```

(3) **Currying:**
Transforming a mulit-argument function into a single-argument, high-order function
```python
from operator import add

def multi_arg_func(f, x, y):
	"""
	>>> multi_arg_func(add, 3, 5)
	8
	"""
    return f(x, y)

def single_arg_func(f):
	"""
	>>> single_arg_func(add)(3)(5)
	8
	"""
    def first_arg(x):
        def second_arg(y):
            return f(x, y)
        return second_arg
    return first_arg

def for_test():
    """
    >>> lambda_single_arg_func = for_test()
    >>> lambda_single_arg_func(add)(3)(5)
    8
    """
    return lambda f: lambda x: lambda y: f(x, y)
```
