Why we can't plug in a value causes a $0$ denominator in a origin form but can do it in a simplified form?
- Assume that $x=a$ will cause a $0$-denominator, we actually restricted that $x≠a$ when simplifying. but limit is to get a output **at a near but not equal** $x$ value. 
How to deal with **square root** sign within **limits**
- rationalize: In $\frac{0}{0}$ indetermined form, use **formula** $(a+b)(a−b)=a^2−b^2$ to convert the difference of two roots to **the sum of two roots**, which won't sum up to be negative.
- also can use **multiplying by the conjugate**
