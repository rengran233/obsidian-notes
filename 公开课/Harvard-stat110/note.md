The _sample space_  of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment. An _event_  is a subset of the sample space , and we say that  _occurred_ if the actual outcome is in A.

The naive definition of probability
$$P_{\textrm{naive}}(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|}=\frac{\textrm{number of outcomes favorable to \(A\)}}{\textrm{total number of outcomes in \(S\)}}$$
Fault: Only be applicable when the number of outcomes is finite, and every chance of outcomes is equal.
