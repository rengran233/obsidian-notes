### 7.1.1 Use package
- Access a class with simple name directly within the same package
- Access a class with canonical name from outside the package
```Java
ug.joshh.animal.Dog d = new ug.joshh.animal.Dog(...);
```
- Import a package to access a class with simple name from outside
```Java
import ug.joshh.animal.Dog;
...
Dog d = new Dog(...);
```
- Put a class into a package by `package`
```Java
package ug.joshh.animal;

public class Dog {
    …
}
```

### 7.1.2 Default package
- Any Java class without package name on the top of it are the part of "default package". We shouldn't use the default package except in very small project.
- We can't import default package and use code inside it.
- Packages are existing folder path in computer
```Java
// From outside the default package
DogLauncher.launch(); // won’t work
default.DogLauncher.launch(); // doesn’t exist
```

### 7.1.3 JAR files
- `.jar` files zip your classes and make you can offer them to other to use as libraries.
